1. Session and Cookies
In Session the session variables are used to store information about one single user, and are avilable to all pages in one application. Typically information stored in session
variables are name, id, and preferences.
Cookies are often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, 
it will send the cookie too.


2.Form handeling in PHP
The most important thing to notice when dealing with HTML forms and PHP is that any form element on HTML page will automatically be avilable to PHP scripts.
When a user fills out the form and clicks on the submit button, form data is sent to another PHP file using form action and 'post' method.
