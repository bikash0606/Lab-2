Qn.1:To print a table in php using class and object.
In this , we use OOP in php logic to initialize value of the array by adding seperate php files.
After that we enter required data and that data is embeded in html document to show in table format.


Qn.2:To print first 20 even numbers.
In order to obtain even numbers we initialize a number =2 and tested condition 
using using if ..statements .If the condition is satisfied then we increment the number by 2 
and loop 20 times to get the required number of even numbers.


Qn.3:Illustrate associative array and for each loop.
The array which has Id key is known as Associative array.
example $pan=array("prajwal"=>30);
For each is a looping  statement which loop task as instructed by the user.
Syntax:
foreach ($array as $value) {
  code to be executed;
}


Qn.4: Illustrate String Functions and Array functions.
Here are some string functions:
strlen()=length of strings
strcmp(str1,str2)=compares strings
strtolower()=converts uppercase to lower 
strtoupper()=converts lowercase to upper
chop():removes white space from right end
trim():removes white space from both end
ltrim():removes white space from the left end


Some array functions are:
is_array():returns if the supplied value is string or not
in_array(value, $arr):returns if supplied value is in the array or not
explode("", $arr):creates an array with the value of the word from $arr ,split on by a space
implode("", $arr):creates a string of elements from $arr seperated by a space
array_push() and array_pop() are used to implement stacks in arrays

Qn.5:Demonstrate the use of array sort
asort():sorting string but keeping the key/value relationship
rsort():sorting value of an array in reverse
ksort():sort the elements by keys maintaining the ke/value relationships
krsort():sort the elements of an array by the keys into reverse order
